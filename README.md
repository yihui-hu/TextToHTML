# TextToHTML

This is a super simple program that processes a plain .txt file into HTML code that can be copy-pasted into any existing HTML file. It should make the process of writing notes on my website slightly easier. Although for now it doesn't have any other features beyond parsing strings, it is definitely a lot easier than writing ```<p>``` and ```</p>``` for every paragraph.

And I guess writing in plain text is a lot cleaner than writing it in the HTML file itself, or in another app and then having to convert it to HTML. There _are_ converters online that do the trick, but I thought that such a functionality should be so simple that I could program it with what little coding experience I have. And so here it my attempt at that.
